# Instructions

1. Brainstorm three different parent classes with two child classes each.
2. Choose one of them to implement in Java.
3. Make sure that the parent class has attributes that are private and public methods to access those attributes.
4. Include a constructor in the parent class that sets those attributes.
5. Make sure the child classes differ from the parent and from each other in some way.  In the child constructors, make a call to the parent's constructor first.
6. Override the toString() function in all of the classes.
7. Create a driver class that instantiates an array of five of your objects--using samples from each of the three classes.
8. Using a loop, print each object to the console.
